    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: September 02, 2025</p>

    <p>By using the MuGa mobile application (the "App"), you agree to comply with these Terms of Service ("Terms"). Please read these Terms carefully before you start to use the App. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use the App.</p>

    <h2>1. Use of the Service</h2>
    <p>MuGa provides a service that allows users to transform their photos into various artistic styles using artificial intelligence technology. You agree to use the service only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms.</p>

    <h2>2. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The App, including all intellectual property rights, copyrights, trademarks, and other proprietary rights, is owned by Murat Çiçek. You may not copy, modify, reproduce, republish, upload, post, transmit, or distribute any content from the App, except as expressly permitted by these Terms.</p>

    <h2>3. User-Generated Content</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You retain all ownership and copyright to the photos you upload through the App.</li>
        <li>By using the App, you grant us a temporary, non-exclusive license to transmit your uploaded photos to a third-party service for the purpose of transforming them into cartoons. This process is necessary to perform the core functionality of the App.</li>
        <li>Once the transformation is complete, our servers do not permanently store your photos.</li>
        <li>You warrant that your uploaded photos and the content you create do not infringe upon any legal rights, copyrights, or other third-party rights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>MuGa uses "coins" as an in-app currency for photo transformations.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>By purchasing in-app items (such as coin packages), you agree that the payment will be processed through the app store from which you downloaded the App (e.g., Apple App Store).</li>
        <li>All in-app purchases are non-refundable. However, if you experience a technical issue with your purchase or the App fails to provide you with the purchased items, please contact our support team.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>The App is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We make no warranties that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of viruses. You use the App at your own risk. We are not responsible for the performance or results of the App.</p>

    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages (including, but not limited to, loss of profits, data loss, or other intangible losses) arising from your use or inability to use the App.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to the Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Any changes to the Terms will be effective immediately after being posted on this page. It is your responsibility to review the changes periodically.</p>
