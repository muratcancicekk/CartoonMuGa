    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: September 02, 2025</p>

    <p>This privacy policy ("Policy") describes how MuGa ("App"), developed and offered by Murat Çiçek ("we," "us," or "our"), collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our App. By using the App, you agree to the terms of this Policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you use the App, we may collect the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Photos:</b> The App's core functionality requires you to upload photos from your device to be transformed. These photos are used solely for the processing purpose and are not permanently stored on our servers.</li>
        <li><b>Device Information:</b> We may collect anonymous information such as device type, operating system version, and unique device identifiers to ensure the App functions properly and to fix errors.</li>
        <li><b>Analytics Data:</b> We collect anonymous data about how the App is used (e.g., which features are most popular, session duration, etc.). This data is used to improve the App and enhance the user experience.</li>
        <li><b>Purchase Information:</b> Anonymous information related to in-app purchases (such as the product ID purchased) may be collected to validate and manage your purchases. Your financial information (e.g., credit card details) is not collected by us; it is processed by the Apple App Store.</li>
        <li><b>User ID:</b> The App uses Firebase Authentication to assign a unique, anonymous ID to users. This ID is used to manage your coin balance and personalize your app experience. No personally identifiable information is linked to this ID.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>App Functionality:</b> To transform your uploaded photos into cartoons.</li>
        <li><b>Experience Improvement:</b> To enhance the App's performance, security, and stability.</li>
        <li><b>Analysis:</b> To understand how users interact with the App and to develop new features.</li>
        <li><b>Purchase Management:</b> To manage your in-app purchases and track your coin balance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Information Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
    <p>We highly value your privacy. The App may share your information with third parties in the following situations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Service Providers:</b> The photo transformation process is performed by an external AI service, the "LightX Editor" API. The photos you upload are temporarily sent to this service for the sole purpose of completing this process. Photos are not permanently stored.</li>
        <li><b>Analytics Services:</b> We use Firebase Analytics to analyze app usage.</li>
        <li><b>Authentication:</b> We use Google's Firebase Authentication to manage anonymous user sessions.</li>
        <li><b>Purchases:</b> In-app purchases are managed by RevenueCat.</li>
        <li><b>Legal Requirements:</b> When required by law or regulatory bodies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other than for the purpose of processing your photos with a third-party service, we do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with advertisers, marketers, or other third parties.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable security measures to protect your information. However, no data transmission over the internet or electronic storage method is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App is not intended for children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will immediately delete that information from our systems.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to the Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When changes are made, we will post the updated date on this page. Changes to the policy are effective immediately after being posted on this page.</p>
